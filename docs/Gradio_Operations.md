# How to use the interface



1. Set the document property. Set the canvas size to 512*512.

<img src='figures/operations/1.png' height=256> --> <img src='figures/operations/2.png' height=256>

2. Choose the draw/edit/delete mode, and create your sketch!

<img src='figures/operations/4.png' height=256>

3. Save the SVG. The sketch and its corresponding automatically computed mask will be displayed on the right immediately.

    - *Note (for Windows users only)*: Remember to save the SVG as `untitled.svg` to a selected directory.

5. Adjust the mask region at middel top if you want. You can draw it directly. There are tools for undo, clearing the mask, and adjusting the mask size.
